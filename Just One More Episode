/*
explanation::
>> We will take an integer number for test case 't'. In the code, we used 'while loop'.

>> In the while loop, one integer 'a' is taken as input.

>> If input-a ( minutes of free time) is greater than 24, which is easily enough to finish watching a 24-minute episode. Hence, the answer is "Yes".

>> If input-a is less than or equal to 24, which is "not enough" or "not strictly before", the exam starts to finish watching a 24-minute episode. Hence, the answer is "No".
