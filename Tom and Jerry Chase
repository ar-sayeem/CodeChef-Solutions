>> In the while loop, we took two integers from the user, one for the speed of Jerry and another for the speed of Tom.

>> If the speed of Tom is greater than the speed of Jerry, "YES" will be printed, meaning Tom will be able to catch Jerry.

>> On the other hand, if the speed of Tom is less than that of Jerry, "NO" will be printed, meaning Tom will not be able to catch Jerry.
